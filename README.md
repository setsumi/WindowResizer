# WindowResizer
https://github.com/zhongyang219/WindowResizer

This is a software for resizing windows, which is especially useful for those windows that cannot be resized. <br>
It also removes the border of the window and forces it to be maximized, which is perfect for programs that can't be displayed full screen, such as certain games.
